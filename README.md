Auto Insurance Industry is one of the Largest Industry with worth $325 Billion. It is mandatory regulatory to buy Vehicle Insurance in most of the countries for which customers pay trillions of dollars as insurance premium for purchasing insurance. 

It is quite often where customers/entity register claims to get the compensation from Insurer for the vehicle/property/injuries. It is an expensive task for any Insurance companies to manually verify/validate each claim and estimate the compensation using traditional approaches. During this process, there are the high chances of processing fraud claims which always incur huge loss for Insurance companies. As per the stats, approx. $30 billion spend by insurance companies for fraud claims. This is the challenging task for companies to identify the fraudulent claims to prevent the loss. 
In this project, we are focusing on detecting the fraudulent claims by implementing the Models using Machine learning techniques. Also, we will evaluate the performance of the Models.
